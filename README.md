My [Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) library for the [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) and its [MOS 6510](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6510) which uses the instruction set of the [MOS 6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502).

Most of my assembly programs were lost - however, two of them survived as [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code) and were [disassembled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disassembler) & annotated for this repository. They implement protocols for communicating with the [Star 10](https://www.c64-wiki.de/wiki/Star_NL-10) printer and the [Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga), latter being connected to the serial port by a custom built cable and running Assembly programs from the my [companion repository](https://github.com/phoyh/misc-asm-68k-amiga-ocs):
* `Printer`: Obtains printer raw data from a `LOAD` command emulated by the Amiga [companion program](https://github.com/phoyh/misc-asm-68k-amiga-ocs/blob/master/commands/PrintC64Star10) and sends it to the *Star 10* for printing.
* `SerialSave`: Loads a program from the [1541 floppy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_1541) as if `LOAD"*",8,1` was performed. This program is then transferred to the Amiga by sending it via the serial port. The Amiga [companion program](https://github.com/phoyh/misc-asm-68k-amiga-ocs/blob/master/programs/C64Saver) handles the other side of the custom made [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol) and saves the file locally on the Amiga. The file name is also transferred by the C64 and needs to be written onto the C64 top-left corner before the process is started.

The programs use several [KERNAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KERNAL) (C64 [OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)) routines. They are included in `docs` as a reference. The bit definitions of used chip registers and their addresses are also found there, as well as the used [zero page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_page) addresses.

Note that I did not have access to a [symbolic](https://www.ibm.com/docs/fr/zos/2.1.0?topic=entries-addresses) assembly [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) when creating these programs. As a result, the programs were written into absolute addresses and several [NOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code))s were inserted between its parts in order to have space for later additions (moving program addresses is very tricky and error-prone).
